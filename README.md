# This is the second step to start playing.

## The second branch will follow the basics of the first branch, inserting a general drawing board inside it which will determine whether a ticket will be winning or losing:
### 1 [ExtractionBoard:](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-2/lottoproject/extractions.py)
      - The following file deals with creating a board object with 5 numbers extracted as the value of the keys of each city.
      The 'print board' function will take care of printing the data of the created object on the screen.

### 2 [Ticket:](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-2/lottoproject/ticket.py)
      - Within the Ticket class, a 'set win' function has been introduced which determines whether a ticket is a winner, after being compared with a general scoreboard
