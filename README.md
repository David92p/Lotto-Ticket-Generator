# This is the first step to start playing.

## The first branch will have inside a packcage called "lottoproject" which will take care of dividing the code:
### 1 [basic](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-1/lottoproject/basic.py)
      - This script introduces a Class named BasicGame that checks and instantiates an object of 
        type city and form.

### 2 game:
      - This script introduces a sub-class named Lot which instantiates a list of randomly drawn numbers.
      - The extraction of the numbers is performed on the basis of a logic of form transmitted 
        by the BasicGame Class.
        
### 3 header:
      - This script takes care of printing a header of our ticket on the screen.
         
    

The following file contains a class called Lotto() which instantiates three parameters such as type of spin, wheel to play, and numbers.
These parameters are controlled by subclasses:
types.py
city.py
Lotto.set_numbers()
header.py:

This file contains an internal class called Header(). It takes care of printing the header of our ticket.
body.py:

This file contain an internal function called body(). This receives 3 instances generated by the Lotto() class to be filled in the body of the ticket.
test.py:

This is a test file to generate our game. An entry point file will be created shortly to start our game
