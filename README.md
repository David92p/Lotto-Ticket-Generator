## This is the first step to start playing.

#### The first branch will have inside a packcage called "lottoproject" which will take care of dividing the code:
## - basic.py: 
   ### This script introduces a Class named BasicGame that checks and instantiates an object of type city and form
    

The following file contains a class called Lotto() which instantiates three parameters such as type of spin, wheel to play, and numbers.
These parameters are controlled by subclasses:
types.py
city.py
Lotto.set_numbers()
header.py:

This file contains an internal class called Header(). It takes care of printing the header of our ticket.
body.py:

This file contain an internal function called body(). This receives 3 instances generated by the Lotto() class to be filled in the body of the ticket.
test.py:

This is a test file to generate our game. An entry point file will be created shortly to start our game
