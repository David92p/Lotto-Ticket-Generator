# This is the first step to start playing.

## The first branch will have inside a packcage called "lottoproject" which will take care of dividing the code:
### 1 [city:](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-1/lottoproject/city.py)
      - The following file introduces the class named "City" which creates and instantiates an object of type city.
      Inside we find a static method useful for determining a correct city type parameter.

### 2 [bet:](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-1/lottoproject/bet.py)
      - The following file introduces the class named "Bet" which creates and instantiates an object of type Bet.
      Inside we find a useful static method to determine a correct bet type parameter.

### 3 [ticket:](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-1/lottoproject/ticket.py)
      - The following class determines and prints a ticket type object on the screen.
      After instantiating the object, using the "print ticket" function we print the ticket with the parameters of the instance created on the screen

### 4 [lotto:](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-1/lottoproject/lotto.py)
      - The following file contains the business logic of our program.
      It contains a ticket object, for the number of tickets to be generated.
      The 'printer' function takes care of printing every object created by the class.
         
### 5 [main:](https://github.com/David92p/Lotto-Ticket-Generator/blob/learning-path-1/main.py)
      - This file contains the script to start the game from the command line.
      Follow the general commands for each branch to launch our program on the screen
